# hatespeechdetectionproject1
This project detects the hate speech using Random Forest classifier with countvectorizer.
This project aims to automatically classify text data into categories such as hate speech, offensive language and non-hate/offensive language. This enables the identification of potentially harmful content on social media platforms, contributing to a safer online environment.


**In this code, i've made a few changes:**
i've switched to using a **TF-IDF Vectorizer** instead of a CountVectorizer. TF-IDF often performs better for text classification tasks.
i've using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier**, which can be more effective for text classification tasks.
Added code to print the confusion matrix and calculate accuracy.
i've removed unnecessary imports and repeated code.
accuaracy is increased to 89.77%
