In this code, i've made a few changes:
i've switched to using a TF-IDF Vectorizer instead of a CountVectorizer. TF-IDF often performs better for text classification tasks.
i've using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which can be more effective for text classification tasks.
Added code to print the confusion matrix and calculate accuracy.
i've removed unnecessary imports and repeated code.
